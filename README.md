🚀 Just completed my Java-based Banking System Project!
This project is a hands-on simulation of a multi-bank environment, built entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It’s designed to reflect real-world banking operations like account creation, loan processing, and bank-specific functionalities.
🔍 Project Overview:
I created a package called Bank that contains 9 Java classes and 1 interface, each playing a distinct role in the system:
🧱 Core Architecture:
- Abstract Classes:
- BankAccount: Defines core account properties and behaviors
- HomeLoan: Encapsulates loan-related attributes and logic
- Interface:
- Loan: Declares loan operations to be implemented by various banks
🏦 Functional Classes:
- AccountFunctionality: Handles user account operations
- BankFunctionality: Manages bank-wide services
- BankLoans: Processes loan requests and eligibility
🏛️ Bank-Specific Implementations:
- BankOfIndia, StateBank, AxisBank: Each bank has its own rules and services, inheriting from the abstract classes and implementing the Loan interface
🚪 Entry Point:
- UniversalBank: The main class that integrates all components. It presents users with a menu to choose from three banks and initiate account creation and loan services.
💡 What I Learned:
- Deepened my understanding of inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and interface implementation
- Practiced modular design, making the system scalable and easy to maintain
- Simulated real-world banking logic, including loan eligibility and account management
📈 Why This Matters:
This project isn’t just academic—it mirrors how actual banking systems separate concerns, enforce rules, and offer user-specific services. It’s a step toward building enterprise-level applications with clean architecture and reusable components.
📂 I’m currently preparing the codebase for GitHub with proper documentation and version control using IntelliJ.
🗣️ I’d love feedback from fellow developers—especially on how to improve scalability or integrate database support in future iterations.
